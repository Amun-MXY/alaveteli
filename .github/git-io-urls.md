# git.io URL shortener URLs

GitHub [announced it was shutting down git.io](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation)
on Friday, April 29, 2022 and as a consequence all links on
[git.io](https://git.io) will stop redirecting.

We've replaced these URLs in the source code and GitHub issues where possible.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages can't be changed, so this table acts as a manual lookup for
git.io URLs known to be included in commits in Alaveteli.
